# Who Ate the Cookie 🍪
A playful, voice-interactive guessing game built with Next.js — now live in production with 100/100 Lighthouse scores across the board.

## 🔎 What It Is

"Who Ate the Cookie?" is a quirky web app where users click on characters to hear who took the last cookie. Behind the fun lies a solid architecture for voice playback, client-server interaction, and web performance best practices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router)
- React (with useEffect, state/event hooks)
- Vercel (preview + production deploys)
- ElevenLabs API (real-time voice generation)
- Custom Audio Handling (preloading, autoplay workarounds)
- Responsive UI + Accessibility

## ✨ Key Features 👱🏻‍♂️ 👩🏽 🧑🏿‍🦱 👧🏻

- 🎤 Dynamic voice generation via serverless /api/speech
- 🧠 Intelligent voice warm-up strategy to prevent first-click delays

- 🎯 Fully responsive layout with high-DPI image optimization
- ♿ Accessible controls and keyboard focus support
- 🧪 Thoughtfully separated RETRY_GAME and RESTART_GAME logic

## 🚀 What I Learned

This was more than a technical upgrade — it became a personal milestone. Through this rebuild, I deepened my skills in:
- Full React-to-Next migration
- Understanding client/server boundaries
- Audio playback quirks and modern browser behavior
- Optimizing UX and performance under real-world constraints
